# Project Context

- **Owner:** Mani
- **Project:** Transpose — agentic pipeline that translates scanned/digital PDF books from Hindi/Punjabi into English using Azure AI Document Intelligence for OCR and Azure OpenAI GPT-4o for literary/cultural translation. Culturally significant words (atman, dharma, karma) must be preserved untranslated and collected into a glossary. Output: publication-ready ePub/PDF.
- **Stack:** Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Azure Container Apps, Azure AI Document Intelligence, Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, Managed Identity, Key Vault, Application Insights
- **Created:** 2026-04-17

## Architecture from Stilgar (2026-04-17T19:50:55Z)

7-stage sequential pipeline (Ingest → OCR → Chunk → Translate → Glossary → Assemble → Export). Test structure mirrors source: `tests/unit/` for module tests (mocking service wrappers), `tests/integration/` for end-to-end against real Azure fixtures. Unit tests validate contracts (type validation, error handling, edge cases). Integration tests ensure Azure SDK calls work correctly. All stages idempotent (re-runs skip completed work). 

**Test requirements:**
- Mock service wrappers (DocumentIntelligenceService, TranslationService, GlossaryService, StorageService) in unit tests
- Real Azure fixtures in integration tests (can reuse Managed Identity)
- Contracts defined in `docs/api-contracts.md` — validate types in unit tests
- Each stage has async `run(input: StageInput) -> StageOutput` signature — test async behavior
- Redis + PostgreSQL for integration tests (fixtures handle teardown)

**Key files:** `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `docs/api-contracts.md`, `src/transpose/models/` (domain objects)
